            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px"><t>In a nutshell, I've always been an experimental person motivated by curiosity. When I was young that manifested in a passion for game design that served as the basis for my entry to the world of Computer Science. In my time since first arriving to Boston in 2017 and beginning my path through higher education, I have learned much and continue to be guided by my curiosity. In addition to game design, I now experiment with web development and machine learning. These two fields in specific are what motivated me to pursue Data Science as the next field to dive into.</p>

            <h3>Wentworth Institute of Technology (January - April 2020)</h3>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px"><i>Assistant Researcher</i></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px">My first Co-Op period saw me employed as a full-time Assistant Researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Networking in Wentworth Institute of Technology, my specialization was epidemiology and social media. During my time there I familiarized myself with classical epidemic models stemming from Kermack and McKendrick's SIR model and how they can be simulated using python's NDLib module. I authored an academic paper proposing modifications to the model which would make it better suited to describing the spread of ideas in online social networks. I then devised an epidemic model specialized in tracking the spread of fake and reputable news in social media. To help observe its behaviour, I created a simulator that would track specific data such as the distribution of fake news cascades. I wrote a second paper proposing this model and exploring the implications about social media newscycles' behaviour it raises. Finally, I undertook an investigation into the role of topology plays in influencing newscycle on social media and recorded my findings in a third paper.<br><br><i>The three papers as well as the library I wrote are unavailable at the moment as they must remain private until the papers are published.</i></p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px"><i>Technical Specialist</i></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px">During the summer of 2019 I worked closely with ARTLAB's Tarek Mourad in order to program, construct and maintain his installation, the <a href="https://www.dailystar.com.lb/Arts-and-Ent/Culture/2019/Jul-10/487183-cave-art-to-crashing-computers-dealing-with-the-human-form.ashx">Automatic Art Validation Machine</a>. The AAVM was comprised of a computer and printer that would passively scan and print recently posted pictures under a predifined hashtag on Instagram on a sheet of paper with the caption "Is this art?" before allowing it to fall on the floor. I wrote the installation's program in python and made heavy use of the requests and beautifulsoup APIs in order to automatically look at hashtags and retrieve recent photos, as well as the win32UI and win32print APIs in order to prepare and print the picture and caption on a sheet of paper.</p>
