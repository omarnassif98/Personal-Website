            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">I'm currently a Junior at Wentworth Institute of Technology. In my free time, I am a hobbyist game designer and am currently working on releasing my first game to the PC and console markets. Having had the opportunity to polish my technical skills in problem-solving as well as my interpersonal skills in team environments throughout my Wentworth studies, I am looking forward to further develop them during my Co-Op term next semester.</p>
